# ConvertMTtoOFX
This software is a wrapper for [mtconverter.jar](http://sf.net/p/mtconverter) by Pieter van Harmelen, so you can click instead of using the command prompt.

It is written in C#, uses .NET 4.5 and makes the following assumptions:
- mtconverter.jar is in C:\Windows (yes, hard-coded)
- Java is installed and java.exe is in your path
